# Matplotlib Case Assignment - The Power of Plots

## Background

Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

Contained in here is an analysis of the results from the regimen used and a brief interpretation of the analysis. 

## Summary of Analysis
* One mouse with ID was removed from the analysis because of duplicates at Timepoint yet different Tumor Volume recorded at the same timepoint hence making the result unrealiable.
* 
*

## Results

* A total of 249 mice were tested, however only 248 mice results were analyzed. 

* Mouse with ID g988 was disregarded
